<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of creating this website was to generate a space to not only share my independent analytical work but to also serve as a portfolio of sorts. Each post will center around dissecting a dataset and revealing any underlying information. I’ll try to keep it fresh and analyze a variety of topics, but ultimately, I’ll explore whatever I find most interesting (so expect a few sports-related posts). My goal is to publish at least a couple of times a month so feel free to contact me about anything! (suggestions, what you liked, didn’t like, etc.)</p>
