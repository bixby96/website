      <description>IntroductionData Pre-ProcessingLoad PackagesImport DataClean DataEjections By Year &amp;amp; CauseEjections By DivisionManagerial EjectionsIntroductionThe 2014 MLB season marked the first time a team could utilize instant replay to challenge an umpire’s ruling. Although technically introduced in 2008, previously only home run boundary calls could be reviewed at an umpire’s discretion. Now with less time spent arguing safe/out calls and more time consulting replay officials in New York, there seems to be less opportunity for players and managers to argue and get ejected.</description>

      <description>IntroductionDrawing inspiration from FiveThirtyEight’s article locating the Stanley Cup’s center of gravity, or the average geographic point of all Stanley Cup winners, I wondered where other leagues (MLB, NBA, NFL) championship trophies’ geographical center could lie. Using Cartesian coordinates for each champion’s city, I mapped the location for each league. The corresponding code and plots are shown below.
